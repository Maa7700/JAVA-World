/*For loop mostly used when we have fig handy from start to end.
 * Its mainly used to iterate a piece of code block.
 * In for loop we need to initialize variable and condition and increment at one place.
 * Its mostly used to avoid code repetition.
 * Code repetition is not a good practice in real time coding.Its a crime.
